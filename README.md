# Simple Linear Regression
This is a simple implementation of Linear Regression to predict salary based on years of experience using the Experience-Salary.csv dataset. The project demonstrates how to train a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

## Project Description
In this project, we use the sklearn library to perform simple linear regression on a dataset that includes information about years of experience and corresponding salaries. The goal is to predict the salary based on years of experience.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
sklearn

## Dataset
## The dataset (Experience-Salary.csv) contains two columns:

exp(in months): The number of months of experience.
salary(in thousands): The salary corresponding to the experience.

## Here is a sample of the dataset:

|exp(in months) | salary(in thousands) |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 4.3           | 77877.59             |
| 9.5           | 130726.01            |
| 7.5           | 110324.29            |
| 6.3           | 94595.91             |
| 2.4           | 52462.97             |
